<h1>Comparative Study Of Fake News Detection Tools</h1>

<b>Existing platforms & tools:</b>
 A variety of tools and platforms exist to detect fake news and assess media bias, each with different goals and technical approaches. <b>"Ground News"</b> is a news aggregation platform that highlights political bias by showing how different ideological outlets (Left/Center/Right) cover the same story, using third-party bias ratings and AI-generated summaries under human oversight. <b>"AllSides"</b> also focuses on political bias but relies entirely on manual methods like blind surveys, editorial reviews, and crowd feedback to rate media outlets on a five-point bias scale; it does not assess individual articles. <b>"NewsGuard"</b> evaluates the credibility of entire news websites using a team of journalists who score them on nine journalistic criteria, providing a 0-100 reliability rating and a color-coded trust label, but it avoids ideological bias labeling. <b>"Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC)"</b> operates similarly, manually labeling sources based on both political leaning and factual accuracy, though it lacks automatic scoring or article-level analysis.

On the academic and research side, <b>"FakeNewsNet"</b> and <b>"LIAR"</b> are widely-used benchmark datasets that contain labeled examples of fake and real news or claims, primarily for training machine learning models rather than public use. <b>"Grover"</b>, developed by the Allen Institute and the University of Washington, is a deep learning model that both generates and detects fake news, achieving high accuracy in identifying AI-generated content through adversarial training. <b>"ClaimBuster"</b>, created by UT Arlington, focuses on detecting check-worthy claims within speeches or articles using NLP and machine learning, helping human fact-checkers prioritize content for verification. Overall, while most consumer-facing tools rely on human editorial processes to assess credibility and bias, research-oriented platforms and newer tools like Grover and ClaimBuster showcase the growing role of AI and machine learning in enhancing fake news detection.
