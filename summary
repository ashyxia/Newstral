1. Comparative Study Of Fake News Detection Tools :

Existing platforms & tools:
A variety of tools and platforms exist to detect fake news and assess media bias, each with different goals and technical approaches."Ground News" is a news aggregation platform that highlights political bias by showing how different ideological outlets (Left/Center/Right) cover the same story, using third-party bias ratings and AI-generated summaries under human oversight."AllSides" also focuses on political bias but relies entirely on manual methods like blind surveys, editorial reviews, and crowd feedback to rate media outlets on a five-point bias scale; it does not assess individual articles."NewsGuard" evaluates the credibility of entire news websites using a team of journalists who score them on nine journalistic criteria, providing a 0-100 reliability rating and a color-coded trust label, but it avoids ideological bias labeling. "Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC)" operates similarly, manually labeling sources based on both political leaning and factual accuracy, though it lacks automatic scoring or article-level analysis.
On the academic and research side, "FakeNewsNet" and "LIAR" are widely-used benchmark datasets that contain labeled examples of fake and real news or claims, primarily for training machine learning models rather than public use. "Grover", developed by the Allen Institute and the University of Washington, is a deep learning model that both generates and detects fake news, achieving high accuracy in identifying AI-generated content through adversarial training. "ClaimBuster", created by UT Arlington, focuses on detecting check-worthy claims within speeches or articles using NLP and machine learning, helping human fact-checkers prioritize content for verification. Overall, while most consumer-facing tools rely on human editorial processes to assess credibility and bias, research-oriented platforms and newer tools like Grover and ClaimBuster showcase the growing role of AI and machine learning in enhancing fake news detection.   

2. Features :

Credibility-Based Ranking :
Unlike existing platforms that rank news by recency or popularity, our system will rank articles based on a credibility score. This score will reflect how trustworthy the source is and how factually accurate the article appears, helping users prioritize reliable information.
Bias Detection :
Our project will identify and label the political bias of news sources using five categories: Extreme Left, Left, Center, Right, and Extreme Right. This helps readers understand the perspective behind the news and make informed judgments.
Fact-Check Integration :
We will connect article claims to existing fact-checking sources (such as Snopes, PolitiFact, or Poynter). If a claim has already been verified, our system will show the verdict (e.g., True, False, Misleading), giving users quick access to verified information.
Sentiment Analysis from Social Media Comments :
To better understand public reactions, our project will analyze comments from social media platforms (such as Twitter or public forums) related to a news article. The system will summarize the overall sentiment — whether people are reacting positively, negatively, or neutrally — offering valuable social context.
Source History Tracker :
Our system will track the historical behavior of each news source — including how often their articles are credible, false, or biased. This allows users to view a reputation profile for each outlet and make trust-based decisions.
News Summarization :
Each news article will be automatically summarized into a short, readable paragraph. This saves time and helps users quickly understand the core message of a story without needing to read the full article.
User Feedback System :
Users will be able to give feedback on whether they believe a news article is accurate, misleading, or biased. This feedback will help improve the system over time and allow for community-driven verification.

3. Technical Architecture & Implementation
Modern fake-news detection systems utilize a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. While earlier approaches relied on traditional machine learning methods like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or logistic regression applied to bag-of-words features, state-of-the-art models now use deep learning. Transformer-based models such as BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet, when fine-tuned on labeled datasets, consistently outperform earlier methods. A 2025 survey concluded that "BERT-based models consistently achieve superior performance" for fake news classification. Some advanced systems like Grover use transformers not only for detecting fake content but also for generating it. Simpler models, such as those used in early versions of ClaimBuster, were based on handcrafted features and LSTM networks.

Due to the limited availability of large-scale labeled Bangla fake news datasets and the absence of real-time user feedback during the early phase, our system adopts a semi-supervised learning strategy. This involves using a small amount of labeled data (e.g., from the BanFakeNews dataset) combined with a much larger corpus of unlabeled Bangla news articles. Techniques such as pseudo-labeling, self-training, and consistency regularization are used to help the model generalize effectively. This approach allows us to reduce reliance on extensive manual annotation while still achieving high model performance.

To support various functionalities, the system integrates several open APIs and libraries. For toxicity detection, Google’s Perspective API is used—although its Bangla language support is still limited. Pretrained models from Hugging Face are used for tasks like bias detection and text classification. Google Fact Check Tools API is integrated for source verification. Additionally, Bangla-specific NLP tools such as BNLP, IndicNLP, and other tokenizers are used for preprocessing tasks like tokenization, stemming, and transliteration. For training purposes, publicly available datasets such as FakeNewsNet, LIAR, and BanFakeNews are utilized, and pretrained models like BanglaBERT are fine-tuned to our use case.

Our system is designed for scalability and real-time performance. News articles are ingested using RSS feeds or public APIs, passed through lightweight classifiers, and their results are cached for quick access. The backend supports GPU and CPU-based inference for high throughput and integrates a microservices architecture for modular scalability. Search functionality is powered by BM25 ranking algorithms, enhanced by neural credibility scoring. While large platforms like Facebook deploy multi-layered machine learning pipelines to process billions of posts, our solution implements a simplified, efficient variant suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Although the system initially relies on semi-supervised learning, it is built with future expansion in mind. Once sufficient user interaction data is available—such as clicks, reports, or engagement metrics—we plan to integrate a reinforcement learning module. This module will allow dynamic and continuous optimization of the system’s credibility scoring and ranking logic based on user behavior. By transitioning to reinforcement learning over time, the system will be able to reward credible content and penalize misinformation based on real-world usage signals, thereby increasing its trustworthiness and effectiveness

4. Bangla Language Adaptation: 
Bangla language adaptation in NLP has advanced significantly in recent years, with the development of several models and resources tailored to the linguistic characteristics of Bangla. Among the most notable is BanglaBERT, a BERT-based model trained on 27.5GB of Bangla text, which outperforms multilingual alternatives in Bangla-specific tasks. MuRIL, developed by Google, is another powerful model that handles code-mixed and transliterated Bangla more effectively than mBERT. XLM-R and IndicBERT are powerful models for Bangla tasks that support multiple languages.They are efficient, requiring fewer resources, and can transfer knowledge from other languages to improve Bangla NLP performance.
Supporting tools like BNLP, iNLTK, and the Indic NLP Library offer functionalities such as tokenization, POS tagging, NER, transliteration, and normalization, addressing Bangla’s script and grammatical complexity. Several datasets have also emerged, including BanFakeNews (for fake news detection), ToxLex_bn (for abusive language), and Bangla Hate Speech Corpora, enabling supervised learning for toxicity and misinformation detection.
However, challenges persist. These include limited annotated corpora for nuanced tasks such as political bias, difficulties in processing code-mixed Bangla-English texts, and domain mismatch with Western-trained models. Despite these, strategies like fine-tuning multilingual transformers, cross-lingual transfer and custom training on Bangla-specific datasets have proven effective. Overall, the combination of pretrained models, curated datasets, and toolkits makes it increasingly feasible to build robust NLP systems for Bangla, though ongoing efforts in data collection, domain adaptation, and tool development are essential for continued progress.
